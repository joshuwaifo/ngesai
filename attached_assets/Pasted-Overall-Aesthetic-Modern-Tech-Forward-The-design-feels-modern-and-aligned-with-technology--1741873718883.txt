Overall Aesthetic:

    Modern & Tech-Forward: The design feels modern and aligned with technology, aiming for a cutting-edge impression.

    Dark Theme: Primarily uses a dark background, which is common in gaming and tech presentations, providing high contrast and a sleek look.

    Minimalist: Avoids excessive decoration, focusing on clean lines and simple shapes.

Color Palette:

    Main Colors:

        Dark background (almost black).

        Bright Cyan / Teal accent color.

        White for text.

    Possible Secondary Colors:

        Hints of slightly darker blue may appear.

Typography:

    Headings: Use a modern, sans-serif typeface that is bold and attention-grabbing. It is mostly likely a Futura style font.

    Body Text: Use a clear, legible sans-serif font. It's typically smaller and has good readability at different sizes. Use a Noto Sans Arabic Font.

    Weight: Heavy and Light font weights should be paired together.

    Emphasis: Use color (cyan) sparingly to highlight key words or phrases.

Imagery & Graphics:

    Abstract Geometric: Use wireframe or low-poly-style geometric graphics to represent futuristic concepts and cityscapes.

    Line Art: Simple lines are used to create shapes and separate sections, contributing to the minimalist feel.

    Emphasis on light source: Add lighting where the edges of shapes connect to add depth and interest.

Layout & Structure:

    Grid-Based: A strong grid structure provides organization. Content is aligned, and white space is used effectively.

    Full-Screen Presentation: The design appears tailored for full-screen displays, likely for presentations.

    Hierarchical Structure: Use heading styles and font sizes to create a clear visual hierarchy.

Additional Design Elements:

    Dividers: Use thin lines of the accent color as dividers between sections.

    Icons: Use simple, clean icons that complement the overall minimalist style.

    Transitions/Animations (If applicable): If this design is used online, subtle animations might enhance the user experience (e.g., fade-ins, line drawing effects).

    Localization: Incorporate Arabic typography gracefully, mirroring the visual style of the Latin script.
